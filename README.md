[My GitHub](https://github.com/LyXoR51)

## Summary
After 10 years in technical roles across the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and automotive industries, I discovered a strong passion for data. Iâ€™ve since decided to focus my career on data science and engineering to build impactful, data-driven solutions.

To support this career shift, I completed a data science bootcamp at JEDHA, where I worked on real-world projects and gained practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and data engineering.

## Skills
- Programming Languages: Python
